# Nitro

## What is nitro?

Nitro is an ongoing work (that I work on-and-off) that aims to be a "better Ionic" (big goal, I know). It works quite well for now, and fixes some issues that I had with Ionic (especially on the back button).

Now that a valid proof-of-concept has been made, I think I will rebuild it later using React, that I've grown rather fond off.

## Demo

A demo of this framework is available on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/arcanis/pen/dPVoRe).
